# republicavelha

procedural story-telling sandbox roguelike written in Lua.

the core itself supports any Lua5.1+, but using LuaJIT instead is highly recommended for performance reasons.

javascript(ES2020 + p5js) version (note this is mostruary only, this version is a republicavelha early alpha sketch, it is not updated since 15/03/2022, do not expect it to be fast or optimized, this was on very early stages of republicavelha please consider running current lua build which is under heavy development) avaliable under:
