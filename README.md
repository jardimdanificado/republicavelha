# republicavelha

procedural story-telling sandbox roguelike written in Lua.



the core itself supports any Lua5.1+, but using LuaJIT instead is highly recommended for performance reasons.

the graphical part(main.lua) does only work with TSnake41 raylib-lua(https://github.com/TSnake41/raylib-lua) although you dont really need to download it interpreter manually, as main.lua download/compile the needed binaries


javascript(ES2020 + p5js) version (note this is mostruary only, this version is a republicavelha early alpha sketch, it is not updated since 15/03/2022, do not expect it to be fast or optimized, this was on very early stages of republicavelha) avaliable under:
